          Every line of code I write is an opportunity to raise the standard of
          content in the world. While that sentiment is of minimal importance to
          most people, I find vast fulfillment in spending time writing crystal
          clear code which provides the user a silky smooth and perfectly
          optimized experience.

          is thought out, and every direction the user takes is planned and
